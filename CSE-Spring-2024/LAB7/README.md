1. 
	- Single-threaded version: main thread takes 5285.974 milliseconds to complete.
	- Multi-threaded version: Thread 1 takes 8373.536 milliseconds to complete. Thread 2 takes 6201.445 milliseconds to complete. The main thread takes 8373.687 milliseconds to complete.

2. No, main thread time does not equal to the sum of thread 1 time and thread 2 time.
3. Single-thread method results in a faster execution time. Single-thread would be faster than multi-thread because of the possible need to share data between threads
4. There are two possible outputs for the same code because threads may execute in different orders.
