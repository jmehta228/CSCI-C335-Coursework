Phase 1
For phase 1 (while using the lab video as a reference for solving this phase) I went into the binary in the r2 and used the debugging feature in order to debug the file and to find the defuse code for this phase. When going into the sym.phase_1 file i therefore found the phrase "The future will be better
tomorrow." which is the defuse code for phase 1.

Phase 2
For phase 2 (while using the lab video as a reference for solving this phase) I went into the binary in the r2 and used the debugging feature in order to debug the file and analyzing the lines to determine the 6 number sequence with the pattern within the code. Furthermore, I figured out that the numbers in the sequence increase at a increasing rate. For example with the sequence "1 3 6 10 15 21", the difference between 3 and 1 is 2, the difference between 6 and 3 is 3, the difference between 10 and 6 is 4, the difference between 15 and 10 is 5, and lastly the difference between 21 and 15 is 6 hence the increase in differences within each consecutive number in the sequence. The defuse code for phase 2 is 1 3 6 10 15 21.

Phase 3
For phase 3, while debugging the code I found that the phrase within the phase code is the 10 character sequence "Aristotle.". Furthermore, I then saw that the phrase I am inputting is being applied to a xor function with another sequence of characters to then output the character sequence "Aristotle.". After figuring out that step, I decided to go to an online xor calculator and input the binary of "Aristotle." and the binary of the other argument to then find what the correct defuse input is supposed to be and therefore found the correct defuse input for this phase is "Hpcpvgync".

Phase 4
For phase 4, as I was debugging this phase code I found that I am supposed to input 2 numbers. I then saw, while debugging, that the second input number is being manipulated within the phase code. Then, using binary numbers I figured out that the correct input 2 number sequence is "1 4294966661".
